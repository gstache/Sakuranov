<p>“This necessarily implies that half their army is in trousers and the
other is in frocks, do I have that correct?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly: they don’t permit the female-type - apologies -
<em>women</em> - they don’t allow them to join.”</p>
<p>“Absurd! Barbaric even. I thought you Eienvechni were an odd bunch
with your theys and thems, I couldn’t possibly imagine submitting to a
system so rigidly divided.”</p>
<p>Tavka stared straight ahead past the chattering pair down the
boarding tube, looking at nothing in particular. They had been subjected
to a series of inane conversations while floating in line, desperately
holding in their lunch from both micro gravity and irritation. Boarding
should have begun nearly an hour ago and the extra time had not been
kind to their delicate gravity-loving insides. Their attention returned
to the two conversationalists, an Eienvechni like them dressed in a
three piece robe with a rakish collar that highlighted their strong
jawline and what they believed to be a Gujranya traveler bedazzled in a
series of increasingly gilded linens.</p>
<p>“Can you believe what he just said about us! A bit rude for a
visitor, am I right?” The Eienvechni nudged Tavka with their
surprisingly firm arm, playfully gesturing at the Gujranya.</p>
<p>Tavka was momentarily stunned, their periwinkle eyes wide, “I
hadn’t-”</p>
<p>“RUDE?” Erupted the Gujranya in mock outrage “<em>HE</em>?” His eyes
twinkled and curls bounced playfully in the low gravity as he corrected
them:</p>
<p>“My ungendered companions, I would never select such an outlier for
my own sobriquet. I have crafted the perfect <em>ir</em>, just a few
shades to the feminine of <em>HE</em>”</p>
<p>With that interruption, Tavka was freed again from participation.
They looked out the small porthole into space and at the station that
spun quietly below them, or besides them, or was it above them? The
entire concept of zero-g was vertigo inducing. They focused instead on
the bulk of the ship that stretched out to the stars. They must be
looking toward the bow, they decided, as the white and rose gold
paneling came to a glittering point and no engines were visible. This
reverie was once more interrupted, this time by the Gujranya:</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t happen to know why we are so delayed, would you?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m very sorry” They responded politely.</p>
<p>“Ah, never the less. OH! A thousand apologies upon the Hierarch, I
have been so <em>rude</em>” another knowing glance at ir’s new
acquaintance “My name is Arjun Santiago de Ascension de Ramaya, second
attache to the honored consular for the Korido domain, representative of
His Majesty’s Raj, but you both can call me Arjay. With whom do I have
the pleasure of speaking?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll go first since you’ve been annoying me the longest.
Sargent Emmit Raskido, retired of the Hierarch’s service, may they guide
me still” With a remarkably canine grin, they turned to Tavka “What
about our slight friend? Who are you?”</p>
<p>This was entirely too forward, but protocol would not permit them to
disclaim as such. Additionally, they did not appreciate being described
as slight. Trim, possibly, but slight seemed intentionally provocative
from the more robust Emmit.</p>
<p>“Tavka Itovanov” they said with a slight bow which almost sent them
into a tumble. Emmit gave them a deft push to counter the spin “Is this
your first time traveling interstellar?” they asked.</p>
<p>“It’s my first time traveling off-planet at all, and thank you for
stopping my spin.”</p>
<p>“It happens to everyone the first time, don’t mention it” Emmit said
with a twinkle.</p>
<p>“Well, <em>Eternal</em> Tavka,” Arjay interjected with a mock
honorific, “What brings you to the very edge of the Korido domain?”</p>
<p>“I’m being transferred to serve as a logistics supervisor at the
agricultural directorate on Sano”</p>
<p>“Tremendous, suitably boring. What about you, my other suitably
androgynous traveler?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a little saved up from my service, and I’ve purchased a
mining claim, ironically-” here Emmit nodded at Tavka “-on the third
moon of Sano.”</p>
<p>“Fortune seeking! Brava! Now if only we could seek our fortune on
this ship forthwith.” Unfortunately for Tavka, Emmit, and Arjay,
boarding would be delayed further still.</p>
<hr />
<p>The weight of three thousand souls has never lessened even after
ninety-nine trips, but one does get better at carrying the burden,
Captain Zhukarwa thought to themselves. Right now they felt the strain
acutely as they were critically behind schedule. The CS Sakuranov was
brand new and had just returned from its space worthiness trials,
unfortunately with a critical failure in the third fusion rocket. As
usual, one problem which appeared to be as simple as a broken impeller
cascaded to the point that an entirely new fusion core would need to be
installed. This was fortunately complete if late. Now all that remained
was a rigorous check list to ensure the safety and functionality. Any
missed step, any failure to identify and resolve problems now could have
consequences ranging from being stranded in space to total annihilation.
They rubbed their greying temple and reflexively checked their high,
short ponytail which remained in place despite all the floating around
they had been up to. As one of the engineers read off another crucial
result a cool breeze tickled their neck hair which meant someone had
entered into the compartment. They recognized the volume of air
immediately as their first officer and rotated themselves around to
chastise them for being in the wrong place.</p>
<p>“Officer Moloto, should you not be overseeing the security of our
boarding operations?”</p>
<p>“Apologies Honored Captain, but the Vassal has arrived”</p>
<p>Zhukarwa’s wind was sucked from their lungs. By the Hierarch! They
were late to accept the Vassal of the entire Korido domain, and
mechanical failures would not be a suitable excuse.</p>
<p>“We have also placed boarding on hold until the Vassal is embarked”
Not only were they in serious breach of protocol, but there were now two
thousand five hundred passengers growing more impatient and motion sick
in the boarding tubes.</p>
<p>“May the Hierarch show mercy upon us” The captain sighed “Moloto, I
empower you to complete this inspection. Have the report prepared in
detail so I may review it before we engage the engines. I have some
grovelling to do.”</p>
<p>“Yes Honored.” Moloto offered a crisp salute and floated past the
captain to speak with the engineer and Zhukarwa pushed themselves out
and to the VIP boarding tube as quickly as physics would allow.</p>
<p>What awaited would sear itself into their dreams for the rest of
their lives. Just ahead of the airlock stood their Chief Steward, the
enigmatic, bald Sirja with their feet anchored to the floor with
magnetic boots and a placid expression the captain recognized as
profound embarrassment. The cause of this embarrassment was opposite of
them: a phalanx of twelve praetorian guards in blood red laced with deep
evergreen surrounding them frowning Vassal who stood on a floating
gravity pad, of which there are four in existence, and their herald
floating in stately orange robes. Zhukarwa shot to the floor, pressing
themselves as flat as possible and with eyes lowered begged:</p>
<p>“Oh Eternal Vassal, Hand of the Hierarch, Scepter of Authority and
Peace, I beseech unto you your forgiveness and mercy for my unacceptable
delay!”</p>
<p>The Vassal narrowed their eyes and clicked their teeth. The herald
responded with a sonorous baritone that shook the very fabric of space
and time:</p>
<p>“The Vassal, Mibu of the House Tokogawlsi, Landarch of Korido, Under
<em>Whom</em> Twenty Billion Souls live beneath the glory of
<em>their</em> 13 suns on <em>their</em> 14 planets and uncountable
smaller stellar bodies, expresses their most extreme displeasure at
having been inconvenienced.”</p>
<p>“My most complete and heartfelt apologies Eternal Vassal Mibu,
Autarch of Austranov, Sovereign of Sano, Hand -” They were briskly
interrupted by The Vassal:</p>
<p>“Oh shut up. Enough, enough, enough, we’ve wasted enough of my time.
Get off the floor Captain”</p>
<p>Zhukarwa flicked upright, eyes still on the floor.</p>
<p>“I am extremely annoyed! I’m not entirely unreasonable or
un-merciful: I know about the mechanical issues as relayed by your
excellent steward, but not withstanding this, you have committed a grave
insult against the Hierarchy as represented by Me and it cannot go
un-punished.” the captain continued to stare a hole through the
floor.</p>
<p>“So!” Mibu clapped their hands and the frown eased “I will wait until
we arrive to decide whether I recommend your immediate dismissal without
honor, or simply reduce your retired rank to an executive officer.
Wonderful, so glad that unpleasant business is concluded. After all
these many years, your patience really does increase, doesn’t it?” They
directed this toward their herald, who nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“Well then captain” Mibu smiled with a wink, “Aren’t you going to
welcome me aboard?”</p>
<hr />
<p>Emmit floated through the vast atrium toward the cabin decks, guided
intermittently by staff in crisp rose and gold pajamas. The overly wound
apparatchik they had conversed with early seemed on the verge of puking,
but Emmit quite enjoyed their time in micro gravity as it relieved the
ever present joint pain from ten years of fighting the Hierarchy’s
battles. Relaxation was the order of this voyage, and they would make
full use of all the facilities the ship had to offer. As one of the
stewards guided them into the seating pod by their cabin door, they
wondered what would become of that slim nerd with the golden tufts and
the amusing diplomat and hoped to see at least one of them again in more
detail. Their hopes were partially answered as Tavka was led to the pod
next to the cabin opposite Emmit’s. Greener than they were in the
boarding tube and wearing an inscrutable expression somewhere between
frustration and terror, they were strapped into the pod. Emmit caught
their attention with a small wave, which they returned with a nod. As
guests continued to trickle past, Emmit said,</p>
<p>“I have a magic cure for gravity sickness”</p>
<p>“Is it gravity?” Tavka replied, drawing a chuckle from Emmit,</p>
<p>“Ha! No, once we reach G, come with me to Bar Jinbei on deck 6, my
treat”</p>
<p>They could see the conflict between Tavka’s desire for isolation and
politeness wage war across their face and offered an out,</p>
<p>“It’s not an order, you can’t hurt my feelings by saying no” This was
not exactly true. Tavka began to reply and was interrupted by the
ship-wide whistle and announcement,</p>
<p>“Well I-”</p>
<p>“Good Evening Honored Guests of the Hokkido Line Ship CS Sakuranov. I
am your captain, Zhukarwa. In a few moments we will be pushed off our
moorings and will begin the acceleration phase of our journey. After six
days under one standard gravity of acceleration, we will reach the edge
of the system where we will shift to the Mitsubesk system, and begin our
six day deceleration to Moskva Station. The crew and staff will take
excellent care of you as we travel, please don’t hesitate to ask for any
assistance.” The whistle sounded again and the entire ship shuddered as
the thrusters pushed it away from Edo station. Tavka regained their
composure,</p>
<p>“I would like any remedy for this discomfort”</p>
<p>Emmit grinned that same canine grin from the boarding tube</p>
<p>“You won’t regret it”</p>
<p>The ship’s engines rumbled to life, pressing the travelers into their
chairs with slowly increasing force until the force reached one gravity.
Another whistle sounded and a new voice announced that it was safe to
move about the ship.</p>
<p>After a brief ramble followed by an elevator ride and some minor
confusion about where exactly Bar Jinbei was on the 6th deck, the pair
found Emmit’s magic cure and a table that looked out past the balcony of
the bar. Below them was the promenade which extended a little further
out, and beyond that was the atrium which soared ten decks above them
and fell another five below to their petal’s arboretum. The wall
opposite the bar was entirely transparent, affording a view of the
glittering golden shift core and the other petals of the ship.</p>
<p>Tavka’s color returned as they ate, but would remain several shades
paler than Emmit despite the sustenance.</p>
<p>“It’s bambam root” Emmit said “Don’t ask me what the compound is, but
it has an anti nausea effect. Also, it’s delicious fried with an herb
sauce”</p>
<p>“Rather like a turnip cake”</p>
<p>“Yes! But better” Emmit took a draft of their cocktail, a mix of some
brown liquor they were previously unaware of and yuzu syrup. Their eyes
once more fell on Tavka, who no longer looked as fragile. Their tufts of
blonde had settled into small short waves on top of their head, shaved
on the side which accented their narrow jawline. Following down their
admittedly slender neck to a knife-sharp collarbone and narrow, sinewy
shoulders Emmit began to appreciate their tautness and with the help of
the alcohol wonder what else could be hiding under that grey tunic.</p>
<p>Their musings were cut short by the unmistakable tenor of Arjay: “My
androgyne <em>amigos</em>! I’m so glad I’ve run into you once again.”
Tavka did not look glad, but Emmit enjoyed teasing ir and retorted “I
didn’t realize you would have selected this petal, I assumed you people
preferred the humidity”</p>
<p>“I take great personal offense!” Arjay said mockingly “This
Mediterranean clime suits me perfectly. We are not a monolith!
Regardless, I have met someone quite interesting” Ir gestured to the
short person next to them in a stylish bob “This is Anastasia, a
military historian of profound depth, who I was just having a
fascinating, nay, stimulating conversation with before I saw my two
friends.” Anastasia bowed politely, Arjay continued: “I also bring an
invitation. I have been invited to dine with the captain tonight and
insisted that you all be included.”</p>
<p>Emmit and Tavka looked at each other and Emmit said “Why not, I’m
sure the food is excellent”</p>
