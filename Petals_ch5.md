## Changes in Attitude
---

Emmit was the cork in a over-agitated champagne bottle, ready to fly violently into a party. The pressure had been building all day, from Troye's unexpected appearance to Ibanez's humiliating interrogation. Nothing could stop them now, apart from choosing the right outfit; they were on a ballistic trajectory to the Rovesnik Room and would hopefully disintegrate on impact. A summer storm with opinions about fashion blew the clothes about their cabin until they settled on a suitable vestment, a black sateen robe with dramatic asymmetric shoulder pads, straight silhouette, and a hemline cut to match just above the knee. Paired with high golden knee-high platform caligae, and their shoulder length hair pulled back into a tight mid ponytail, they called to mind the Korido new wave of years past. Emmit appraised themselves in the door mirror, locked eyes with their reflection and felt satisfied that the heavy bar of eye shadow both enticed and frightened. They reached for the latch but their hand stopped short: they were nervous about seeing Troye again. They set they shoulders, drew their breath in, and expelled the nerves; they were too pissed off about this morning to let the fear of being known get in the way of a good time.

The Rovesnik Room was a Vecchny-forward club, sharp angles, black clothes, dark blues and pulsing bass. Emmit strutted past the frosted white bar and into the grinding pit of dancers, swimming through them to the table alcoves on the far side. It was easy to find Troye and their friends, as they were the biggest people in the club. The five of them were clustered around a standing bar table covered in empties, Emmit was going to have to catch up. They reached around Troye's shoulder, grabbed their drink from their hand, and quaffed it before they could object.

"Who drank my drink?" they shouted as they spun around. Emmit burped and replied "I did", handing the empty glass back to their erstwhile comrade. Troye's eyes lit up as they shouted over the music "The thief! I found them!" turning to the other four large people around the table they announced "This is Raskido, my counterpart in the 17th Korido Saber Company on Lanterra, the Demon of Den Faal!"

Emmit saluted playfully and corrected Troye "I retired as the Master Sargent of the Korido Sabers, if you please"

Troye bowed in return, "I am corrected. Let me introduce my compatriots from the Blyvsanto First Army-" They did an admirable job introducing their former fellows, but Emmit was beginning to feel the heat from the drink they stole and could not remember a single name. Distinguishing one from the other was also a challenge because they were all still augmented for combat. Gender had been carved from Eienvechni society with the initial Great Unification thousands of years ago, but differences in genes, primary and secondary sex characteristics, and environments produced a colorful tapestry of peoples, even if they tended towards androgyny in presentation because it was currently fashionable. The pallet of Troye's compatriots was best described as two tone- "large" and "slightly larger". They were all nearly the same height, with the same short shorn hair, and wearing simple grey clothes with minor differences in trim, the only differences were in skin, eye and embellishment. Emmit settled on a classification system of "blue eyes", "two rings", "one scar" and "many scars". 

"Blue eyes" was most likely female-type, Emmit assessed. The treatments all frontline infantry underwent to increase their strength and reflexes produced masculine characteristics while active, but Emmit could see a softness at the edges that only a fellow augmentee would notice. The others were harder to tell, and then immediately disavowed the thought: guessing at the primary sex of others was taboo. Two rings had two golden rings on their fourth finger of their right hand, complementing their deep brown skin. One Scar was unusually pale, and sullen. Many Scars was a reasonable amount of pale, and nearly fell over when they laughed. They were all trained killers, and like Troye they were working privately for an secret client. Emmit would not be intimidated, but they felt vulnerable around them which would not have been true a year or two ago when they were likewise augmented.

"Huzzah, more spirits!" bellowed Many Scars as a new bottle was delivered to their table, "You sure they actually made you a Lieutenant? Old Walnuts would never order bottle service" Troye clapped them on the shoulder "Good thing I'm not old walnuts!" and Many Scars fell off their seat in a spasm of guffaws to an eye-roll from One Scar.

"I think we "

- the group toasts and dances. They are in the groove
- Troye pulls Raskido aside to have a heart to heart about the changes they've both undergone (specifically Emmit and their body and plans)
- they return to partying (toast, dance, toast, dance)
- Troye puts the moves on Emmit on the dance floor, they have *chemistry* and then kiss
- Emmit has A BAD TIME: They taste different, they seem taller, everything is wrong
- They break off the kiss, Emmit goes to the table to get another shot 
- the gang is already there
- this time one scar toasts Fujschev 
- Emmit is stunned and drunk, and when Troye joins in, Emmit sneaks away, tears and stumbles.
