## Changes in Attitude
---

Emmit was the cork in a over-agitated champagne bottle, ready to fly violently into a party. The pressure had been building all day, from Troye's unexpected appearance to Ibanez's humiliating interrogation. Nothing could stop them now, apart from choosing the right outfit; they were on a ballistic trajectory to the Rovesnik Room and would hopefully disintegrate on impact. A summer storm with opinions about fashion blew the clothes about their cabin until they settled on a suitable vestment, a black sateen robe with dramatic asymmetric shoulder pads, straight silhouette, and a hemline cut to match just above the knee. Paired with high golden knee-high platform caligae, and their shoulder length hair pulled back into a tight mid ponytail, they called to mind the Korido new wave of years past. Emmit appraised themselves in the door mirror, locked eyes with their reflection and felt satisfied that the heavy bar of eye shadow both enticed and frightened. They reached for the latch but their hand stopped short: they were nervous about seeing Troye again. They set they shoulders, drew their breath in, and expelled the nerves; they were too pissed off about this morning to let the fear of being known get in the way of a good time.

The Rovesnik Room was a Vecchny-forward club, sharp angles, black clothes, dark blues and pulsing bass. Emmit strutted past the frosted white bar and into the grinding pit of dancers, swimming through them to the table alcoves on the far side. It was easy to find Troye and their friends, as they were the biggest people in the club. The five of them were clustered around a standing bar table covered in empties, Emmit was going to have to catch up. They reached around Troye's shoulder, grabbed their drink from their hand, and quaffed it before they could object.

"Who drank my drink?" they shouted as they spun around. Emmit burped and replied "I did", handing the empty glass back to their erstwhile comrade.
