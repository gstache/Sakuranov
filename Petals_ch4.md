## Chapter 4: Law and Order
---

Ibanez stooped to examine the dead vassal, gently moving their hair with a sterile probe. Mibu Tokogawlsi, Vassal of the Hierarch, Autarch of Austronov, Steward of the Korido Domain lay unceremoniously face-first on the pine needle floor of a redwood copse in the temperate arboretum. Ibanez had arrived with a team of six security guards who had been scanning, cataloguing, and examining the scene. From what he could see immediately, this had the hallmarks of an accident. Roughly one stride behind the vassal was a root cresting out of the ground and the divot underneath implied a trip. In what might have been the greatest coincidence of his entire career, Mibu had landed on the only exposed rock for twenty meters. Initial exam indicated blunt trauma to the head severe enough to rupture the skin, smash the skull and squash some brain matter. A pool of deep red-brown drying blood was being absorbed into the forest floor. He managed to capture this information despite the constant seething from the Praetorian Imperator who stalked behind him like a mountain lion.

"You will provide me with constant updates as your team progresses" The Imperator growled.

"Of course, Honored Imperator"

"I'll be watching you and your investigation closely"

"Of course, Honored Imperator"

"Naturally I would prefer if someone more suitable handled this investigation."

Ibanez steeled himself and turned around to face the Imperator. They stood taller than Ibanez, broader and more muscular, and appeared bigger still in their red armored uniform. Their face, however, was soft, almost feminine to Ibanez's eye.

"Imperator, I am the chief of security for the *Sakuranov*. I have been a chief of security on three other flagship vessels for the Hokkido Line, my record is unimpeachable. I ask you, what do you mean by 'more suitable'?"

"My apologies, honored Chief of Security" the Imperator sneered, "I should have been more direct, I know you people have trouble with the subtlety of Eienvechni culture. You are a foreigner, one of the guests and suspects is also a foreigner, from the same savage tribe no less. The Vassal to the Hierarch themselves is dead, and a *Gujranya* is an unsuitable choice to investigate."

Ibanez drew himself up to his full meter and a half, chest to stomach with them, "I am no foreigner. I was born to the Hierarchy, I serve the Hierarch in all things, I live for Eienvechni. Crucially, I did not lose my charge to a slip and fall in the woods."

The Imperator exploded, shoving Ibanez halfway across the clearing. Ibanez tumbled backward and smacked his head on the spongy forest floor.

"You insolent BARBARIAN! You gender-obsessed, indolent, perverted, over-spiced-"

"Enough" The captain did not yell, and for Ibanez, they never had to. The word silenced the Imperator's tirade and hung resonant in the golden light filtering through the redwoods. Viseli Zhukarwa was everything Ibanez aspired to be, as an officer and as a citizen of the Hierarchy. He saw them as the rock upon which the wave breaks, unyielding and stoic.

The captain continued, "Chief Ibanez, the situation report please." Ibanez relayed the observable information as his team had acquired it: the scene appears to be a trip and fall, but the additional footprints and astronomical odds of hitting the one rock prevented Ibanez from declaring it an accident.

"Thank you. Do you have persons of interest?"

"Yes, I have a brief list, and I plan on using the steward staff to deliver summons-" The Imperator interrupted Ibanez: "No need. My Praetorians have already taken them into custody."

"What!?" Ibanez was furious, and The captain seemed to share his feelings, "I would second Mr. Ibanez. What. Have. You. Done. With. Guests?" Each word was a stab into the Imperator's haughty self-assured demeanor.

"Quite simply, I've delivered your guests into your brig"

The captain was quiet for a moment. They smoothed their ponytail, looked up, then stared directly into the eyes of the Imperator. "Your charge is dead, your role here is finished. You have no authority on this ship, and your praetorians will surrender their armor and weapons at their earliest convenience"

The Imperator began to object, but the captain raised their hand and silenced them once more. "However, because the deceased is the Vassal of the Korido domain, and of great importance to the Hierarch, you will be allowed to observe the investigation. You will not interfere, interrupt or interdict, do you understand?"

The Imperator was totally still. "I ask again, do you understand?"

The Imperator bowed deeply. "Yes, Honored captain. Expect my objection to be delivered to the Hierarchy as soon as I return to my quarters"

"I expect no less. Ibanez, I'll send Moloto down to meet you and the Imperator and review the reconstruction. Then, conduct your interviews and get my guests back to their trip."

The captain smartly adjusted their uniform and turned heel to return to the bridge.

Tavka had never in their life ever been arrested. They had not so much as been tardy three times, two of which where excused, let alone received a formal rebuke in writing, the idea that they could ever be or have been arrested would be fanciful, farcical. Yet here they sat is a circular detention bay. A dozen cells formed a ring around a central command console, their doors facing inward spaced two meters from the outer edge of the console. They were alone in their cell, but others were imprisoned, namely, his erstwhile companions, Arjay and Emmit. Anastasia, the dinner guest and historian was likewise detained.

Embarrassment flushed their ears. It was beyond all imagining, and yet it was no hallucination. They had just fallen from the top of the boulder, trapped in the deflating aero-gel from their crash pad, when four strong, red arms ripped them out of the gel. Without explanation, they were marched straight to ship's security through the crowded bio-dome and then the shopping midway. Eyes, widening at the red and green Praetorians of the Hierarch's Hand, schooled after them. The self loathing shame of it, knowing thousands of people saw you betray their state, nearly drowned Tavka. At the nadir, the deep black, there hissed a small geyser of rage. The geyser grew in intensity as they listened to the overlapping complaints, erupting finally, uncontrollably in one word:

"*QUIET!*"

This outburst from the slight and reserved apparatchik indeed silenced the other four. Silence for a few more seconds, then Emmit tentatively interjected,

"I'm sure it's nothing to worry about"

"Nothing to worry about?" Tavka replied tensely, "We were arrested by the Vassal's Praetorians under suspicion of their murder, in public!" They were getting breathless, "I'm sure you know all about getting arrested, Emmit" The rage was curdling into panic self pity, but they couldn't back down now, they had to save face.

"That's an incredibly discourteous thing to say, Tavka" Emmit replied, looking genuinely hurt. Tavka wanted to apologize, but continued on stubbornly and tearfully,

"And YOU -" they flung their arm out toward Arjay, "-YOU got me into this mess. If you hadn't felt such great pity for poor, grey, Tavka I wouldn't be here. I would be enjoying my trip, alone, how I intended. I guess I could have said 'no', but could I have truly?" The tears were truly coming now "I don't think I could! I don't think I could." They buried their face in their arms "I could not, This is my own doing."

Arjay was unusually grave and replied stonily, "This is not your doing, obviously. The Vassal is dead, we are the last to have direct contact with them besides their staff. They believe one or more of us murdered the Vassal. Then there is the real problem." Ir cracked an ironic smirk, a touch of the Arjay sparkle returned, "The problem, compatriots, co-conspirators, is that we are still here, in these cells." The group all looked at the other's confinement as though a new truth could be found in it. "This means that they can't rule us out. This ship, it is a great spy apparatus. Every electronic communique can be intercepted, all traffic tracked, and crucially, there are cameras and sensors everywhere. Deep in the bowels of this beast, they can re-create in perfect detail a virtual construction of any part of the vessel at any time. The problem is that they can't see what happened, and such cannot discount any of us. This is a problem larger than the five of us in this room." 

Ir looked directly into Tavka's eyes for a moment longer than was accidental, snatched irs gaze back onto the other members and continued, "So no, it is certainly something to worry about."

"What's the possibility that this is an error?" Moloto asked Ibanez. They, along with the Imperator, stood in the security recreation suite, wrap around visors on their heads projecting a perfect three dimensional recreation of the arboretum into their eyes. Under their feet, omni directional track floors simulated their movement through the projected space. They had viewed the recreation of the Vassals death at least a dozen times, and each time they saw the same irregularity. The Vassal appeared to be speaking to someone who was not there, then turned, and received a ghostly shove, tripping over the exposed root and falling face-first onto the rock that cracked their skull. Despite millennia of belief in the existence of ancestral spirits among the Eien and the monotheistic purgatory of the Vechni, modern science had ruled out the para natural.

"That's unlikely, because of how targeted the erasure is" Ibanez replied. "Additionally, someone accessed the system in the interregnum between Mibu's death and our review, but that access code has been encrypted. Information Systems is working on decoding."

"Then we can't use the ships security system to rule any suspect out" The Imperator interjected, appearing much leaner without their crimson armor.

"Yes, and please refrain from contributing further" Ibanez admonished.

"They are absolutely correct, however" Moloto contributed. They were always undermining, Ibanez thought. Of course the Imperator was correct, and Ibanez was about to say the same, but Moloto never missed an opportunity to direct credit away from their subordinates, especially if that subordinate was foreign. Possibly Ibanez was being to harsh, maybe he could attribute their behavior to pure ambition rather than something uglier.

"Yes, they are" Ibanez said begrudgingly. "There's more to the picture than what the ships eyes can see, or not see in this case" He called up an engineering overlay. The perfectly imaged forest around them now glowed with the blue lines of sub-terranean deck plates, mycelium of green, yellow and purple conduits snaking in every direction, and crucially red outlined access hatches leading to service crawlways.

"Pay special attention to access hatch 1-s-34-g" The hatch nearest to the clearing was highlighted. "This hatch was accessed two hours before the arrival of the Vassal. It's not a high level security hatch, so no credentials are required, however a service key signal is. We know the hatch was then opened three minutes before the Vassal's death. The hatches on the other side of the crawlway were not opened during this time. These facts indicate the killer is-"

"An insider, possibly, or someone with a connection to the ship." Moloto interrupted. Ibanez tightened his fists and then relaxed them. Again, the underminer. "Or the killer has an accomplice. I-"

"Intend to interview the detained suspects. Under *my* supervision."

"Of course, Honored First Officer."

Emmit sat in the interrogation room across a small table from Ibanez. His Grey tunic nearly blended into the walls, except for the gold piping and single gold and rose shoulder knot. His brown hair was slicked back from his brown forehead and his brown mustache was carefully shaped and waxed, not a single hair out of place. Boots, knee-high, matched spotless white gloves. He reminded Emmit of some of the more aristocratic officers they'd met in the service, but his pronouns marked him as decidedly not of the Hierarchy. They were not so put together, as the iron fists of Vassal Mibu had seized them from the beach, half-nude. Only after vigorous negotiations and quite a scene did they allow them to put on their linen cover up, which now felt more transparent than sheer.

"Let us start at the beginning. How does a Sargent of the Hierarch's employ afford a ticket aboard the Hokkido Line's flagship?" He asked the question without making eye contact, peeling his white gloves off delicately and setting them on the table.

Emmit wanted to peel the skin off of his hands for that question, so they settled with not answering. Which Ibanez seemed content with. He just sat and stared at them, almost daring them to keep silent. Eventually, even Emmit broke and answered.

"I requested my pension in a lump sum." They said flatly.

"And for what purpose?" He responded tersely, eyebrow ever so slightly raised.

"To purchase a mining claim in the Mitsubesk system. I used the rest to pay for this ride"

"That must have used up all of your pension.

"Very much so."

"So one could say you need more money."

"One could say this."

"Indeed." He leaned forward, "A decorated infantry soldier with two campaigns under their belt, in need of funds, would make a perfect target for a foreign agent. You were approached by such an agent before boarding this vessel, correct?"

"I mean, yes but he was invi-"

Ibanez cut them off with a flourish of his hand, "Yes is sufficient." Emmit could reach that hand and break it before he could back away. The satisfaction might be worth the trouble.

"Did Arjun Santiago de Ascension de Ramaya, known to you as 'Arjay', offer your money in exchange for the murder of the Vassal Mibu of House Tokogawlsi?"

"You are saying they were murdered?" The surprise was genuine in Emmit's voice. Ibanez drew back slightly, clearly having offered information sooner than he intended. "No, Ir didn't offer me money to murder the Vassal."

"What were your whereabouts this morning?"

Emmit was back to being annoyed: after all of the infuriating condescension from  a half-witted security guard masquerading as a detective, the one question that mattered was finally asked.

"I had some coffee at the second class inclusive, and then went to the beach, where the Eternal Vassal's goon squad arrested me, half naked, in public."

"Can anyone corroborate this?"

"I had to check in to the inclusive cafeteria, and Troye Markich. We talked on the beach"

Ibanez made a note of both of these, and with unsupported gravitas said, "You may return to your cell: we'll speak again."

---

"Well it's not Doctor Osu yet, I still have to complete my thesis. Anastasia will do just fine, officer." They said with flirtatious deference. Ibanez would not be taken in by the suspect's transparent manipulation, he assured himself. He would be resolute, and critical, and focused, no matter how pleasant deference felt.

"I will use Anastasia then. " He cleared his throat and cut to the quick, "Did you kill Vassal Mibu Tokogawlsi?"

Anastasia's eyebrows shot up, and they drew back with a shocked gasp. A hand flew up to cover their mouth which hung agape until they leaned forward.

"The Vassal is...dead?" The pause was dramatic but Ibanez felt it genuine. "I thought that must have been a mistake when they arrested me." 

Their eyes fell to the floor and they shook their head slowly from side to side. With a deep sigh they drew their eyes back up to their interrogator and quietly asked, voice trembling, "You think I killed them?"

Ibanez was taken aback by the hurt on their face, and softened his posture, reassuring them, "I am simply ruling out everyone who was with the Vassal last. Where were you today, from mid morning to mid afternoon?"

They seemed to take some comfort in his response, but remained small in the chair across from him. With a tilt of their head and bashful smile, they replied "It's a guilty pleasure of mine, I was in the ship's Imperial Library all last night until this afternoon. I so enjoy the physical copies of Poetry from Hierarchs past, and got carried away as usual."

Ibanez didn't immediately respond: he found a short pause elicited more details.

"You can check the sign out records, the works I had couldn't be removed from the library, and I even ordered a few libations to keep my energy up."

He would check those records and the service records from last night to corroborate. They could have slipped out and returned, so he would question the clerks and servers. However, he was fairly satisfied with this answer, and with no obvious connection to the Vassal he didn't find them a credible suspect. There remained one final question:

"How do you know Arjun?"

"I don't: he approached me while I was taking tea in the atrium."

Another person collected by this Arjun. He could feel the outline of a conspiracy forming.

Tavka sat folded into themselves, distantly aware of the security chief across from them through the fog of self loathing and shame. They were back in the small apparatchik's office on that dismal Hanstok winter day, receiving divorce papers with hands still wet from the rain and knowing, then as now, that their innate passivity was to blame. 

"I'm security Chief Ibanez, and according to your papers, you are Tavka Itovanov" Tavka's sullen reverie stopped abruptly and they sat upright.

"Yes, that's me"

Ibanez looked at them the way one looks at a drunkard stumbling out of a bar in the morning. "That wasn't a question," He replied. It had seemed that way to Tavka, but they lacked the will to argue.

Ibanez shifted in his chair and laid his white gloves on the table. "Unlike the other dinner guests, I don't need to ask you many background questions, your being here has been explained in triplicate and paid for by the state. Congratulations on the promotion, may the spirit of assiduity assist in your efforts."

The words joined the chorus of rumination at a dissonant forte, souring Tavka's insides and causing their gorge to rise. Was there so little to their life? 'Yes' was the unanimous, acidic, reply. While Tavka wallowed Ibanez continued his interrogation un-phased by their obvious emotional distress, "What I need you to tell me is where were you this morning until you were escorted into our care?"

Tavka's incredulity at the flippant description of their arrest, the marks of which still chafed their wrists, raised itself above the babble in their mind. Indignation followed shortly after, coursing through their veins and tensing their muscles.

"I was rock climbing, where your heavy-handed associates snatched me" they answered tersely. Ibanez's eyebrows raised but he did not otherwise react to Tavka's brusque response. He waited a moment and asked, "Can anyone vouch for your whereabouts?"

"No, but-" Tavka began, as Ibanez attempted to cut them off, "No will suffice-" but Tavka was not finished and they raised their voice over the inspector who in turn raised his,

"*I was saying* that it is absurd that a vessel of this caliber-"

"I'm asking the questions Ito-"

"- can't tell you where a guest was -"

"We aren't talking about the ship!"

"- WHERE A GUEST WAS. Absurd! Furthermore-"

"You do not set the agenda-"

"FURTHERMORE! I can vouch for the location of Emmit"

"Impossible to do my job- could you repeat that?"

"I can vouch for the location of Emmit?"

"Yes, exactly. How can you vouch for the location of Emmit?"

"I saw them speaking with a person on the beach at the same time as I was climbing."

Ibanez leaned back in his chair, and relaxed the white-knuckle grip he had on his gloves. Tavka had clearly upset him, but for the moment they didn't care.

"You could have concocted this cover story with them in the brig." He said flatly. Tavka couldn't suppress their eye-roll. "Then why place us all together after arresting us?" 

Ibanez was silent for a moment too long, and Tavka realized that he didn't have an answer for why, so they helpfully provided options, "Either you are a half wit detective, plying their trade as a interstellar convenience guard" As Ibanez began to open his mouth Tavka sped up, "OR you didn't have us arrested, in which case you aren't in control of your own security." They had certainly overstepped protocol now, and the vein pulsing in Ibanez's forehead confirmed this.

Cold as space and flat as the plains of Hanstok he replied "You may go," and they obliged.

--- 

Ibanez was wearing thin. The day had been long, and night promised to be longer still as he followed up on each alibi. He looked left at the small camera he knew was hidden in the wall, knowing as well that Moloto and the Imperator were watching him closely. Returning his thoughts to those guests, he was less than excited to interview their final suspect, Arjun. Not for any reason to do with Arjun specifically, but rather the additional scrutiny he, a loyal subject of the Hierarchy, would receive while interviewing ir due to their shared ethnicity. The Hierarchy was in a multi-decade period of peace with The Raj but it had been hard won after several trade wars, cold wars, arms races and one spectacularly inconclusive physical war. The Eienvechni xenophobia combined with the history and peer-state status of the Raj meant that even in this pax economicus, Gujranyi were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most.

A burly security guard planted Arjay into ir seat across from Ibanez. He gave a officious two-fingered wave towards the door and the guard obliged. Arjun, or Arjay for the casual, could have come from Chati-Andaluse Films central casting. Medium height, casually athletic build, comforting walnut eyes set in a warm, tan face, accented with saffron shadow matching ir tunic upon which tight black curls rested. Ir was undeniably attractive, he had to admit.

"My, aren't we a dashing pair" Arjay announced, gesturing to irself and Ibanez with their cuffed wrists.

"That is true only insofar as there are two of us." Ibanez retorted.
