## Chapter 4: Law and Order
---

Ibanez stooped to examine the dead vassal, gently moving their hair with a sterile probe. Mibu Tokogawlsi, Vassal of the Hierarch, Autarch of Austronov, Steward of the Korido Domain lay unceremoniously face-first on the pine needle floor of a redwood copse in the temperate arboretum. Ibanez had arrived with a team of six security guards who had been scanning, cataloguing, and examining the scene. From what he could see immediately, this had the hallmarks of an accident. Roughly one stride behind the vassal was a root cresting out of the ground and the divot underneath implied a trip. In what might have been the greatest coincidence of his entire career, Mibu had landed on the only exposed rock for twenty meters. Initial exam indicated blunt trauma to the head severe enough to rupture the skin, smash the skull and squash some brain matter. A pool of deep red-brown drying blood was being absorbed into the forest floor. He managed to capture this information despite the constant seething from the Praetorian Imperator who stalked behind him like a mountain lion.

"You will provide me with constant updates as your team progresses" The Imperator growled.

"Of course, Honored Imperator"

"I'll be watching you and your investigation closely"

"Of course, Honored Imperator"

"Naturally I would prefer if someone more suitable handled this investigation."

Ibanez steeled himself and turned around to face the Imperator. They stood taller than Ibanez, broader and more muscular, and appeared bigger still in their red armored uniform. Their face, however, was soft, almost feminine to Ibanez's eye.

"Imperator, I am the chief of security for the *Sakuranov*. I have been a chief of security on three other flagship vessels for the Hokkido Line, my record is unimpeachable. I ask you, what do you mean by 'more suitable'?"

"My apologies, honored Chief of Security" the Imperator sneered, "I should have been more direct, I know you people have trouble with the subtlety of Eienvechni culture. You are a foreigner, one of the guests and suspects is also a foreigner, from the same savage tribe no less. The Vassal to the Hierarch themselves is dead, and a *Gujranya* is an unsuitable choice to investigate."

Ibanez drew himself up to his full meter and a half, chest to stomach with them, "I am no foreigner. I was born to the Hierarchy, I serve the Hierarch in all things, I live for Eienvechni. Crucially, I did not lose my charge to a slip and fall in the woods."

The Imperator exploded, shoving Ibanez halfway across the clearing. Ibanez tumbled backward and smacked his head on the spongy forest floor.

"You insolent BARBARIAN! You gender-obsessed, indolent, perverted, over-spiced-"

"Enough" The captain did not yell, and for Ibanez, they never had to. The word silenced the Imperator's tirade and hung resonant in the golden light filtering through the redwoods. Viseli Zhukarwa was everything Ibanez aspired to be, as an officer and as a citizen of the Hierarchy. He saw them as the rock upon which the wave breaks, unyielding and stoic.

The captain continued, "Chief Ibanez, the situation report please." Ibanez relayed the observable information as his team had acquired it: the scene appears to be a trip and fall, but the additional footprints and astronomical odds of hitting the one rock prevented Ibanez from declaring it an accident.

"Thank you. Do you have persons of interest?"

"Yes, I have a brief list, and I plan on using the steward staff to deliver summons-" The Imperator interrupted Ibanez: "No need. My Praetorians have already taken them into custody."

"What!?" Ibanez was furious, and The captain seemed to share his feelings, "I would second Mr. Ibanez. What. Have. You. Done. With. Guests?" Each word was a stab into the Imperator's haughty self-assured demeanor.

"Quite simply, I've delivered your guests into your brig"

The captain was quiet for a moment. They smoothed their ponytail, looked up, then stared directly into the eyes of the Imperator. "Your charge is dead, your role here is finished. You have no authority on this ship, and your praetorians will surrender their armor and weapons at their earliest convenience"

The Imperator began to object, but the captain raised their hand and silenced them once more. "However, because the deceased is the Vassal of the Korido domain, and of great importance to the Hierarch, you will be allowed to observe the investigation. You will not interfere, interrupt or interdict, do you understand?"

The Imperator was totally still. "I ask again, do you understand?"

The Imperator bowed deeply. "Yes, Honored captain. Expect my objection to be delivered to the Hierarchy as soon as I return to my quarters"

"I expect no less. Ibanez, I'll send Moloto down to meet you and the Imperator and review the reconstruction. Then, conduct your interviews and get my guests back to their trip."

The captain smartly adjusted their uniform and turned heel to return to the bridge.

Tavka had never in their life ever been arrested. They had not so much as been tardy three times, two of which where excused, let alone received a formal rebuke in writing, the idea that they could ever be or have been arrested would be fanciful, farcical. Yet here they sat is a circular detention bay. A dozen cells formed a ring around a central command console, their doors facing inward spaced two meters from the outer edge of the console. They were alone in their cell, but others were imprisoned, namely, his erstwhile companions, Arjay and Emmit. Anastasia, the dinner guest and historian was likewise detained.

Embarrassment flushed their ears. It was beyond all imagining, and yet it was no hallucination. They had just fallen from the top of the boulder, trapped in the deflating aero-gel from their crash pad, when four strong, red arms ripped them out of the gel. Without explanation, they were marched straight to ship's security through the crowded bio-dome and then the shopping midway. Eyes, widening at the red and green Praetorians of the Hierarch's Hand, schooled after them. The self loathing shame of it, knowing thousands of people saw you betray their state, nearly drowned Tavka. At the nadir, the deep black, there hissed a small geyser of rage. The geyser grew in intensity as they listened to the overlapping complaints, erupting finally, uncontrollably in one word:

"*QUIET!*"

This outburst from the slight and reserved apparatchik indeed silenced the other four. Silence for a few more seconds, then Emmit tentatively interjected,

"I'm sure it's nothing to worry about"

"Nothing to worry about?" Tavka replied tensely, "We were arrested by the Vassal's Praetorians under suspicion of their murder, in public!" They were getting breathless, "I'm sure you know all about getting arrested, Emmit" The rage was curdling into panic self pity, but they couldn't back down now, they had to save face.

"That's an incredibly discourteous thing to say, Tavka" Emmit replied, looking genuinely hurt. Tavka wanted to apologize, but continued on stubbornly and tearfully,

"And YOU -" they flung their arm out toward Arjay, "-YOU got me into this mess. If you hadn't felt such great pity for poor, grey, Tavka I wouldn't be here. I would be enjoying my trip, alone, how I intended. I guess I could have said 'no', but could I have truly?" The tears were truly coming now "I don't think I could! I don't think I could." They buried their face in their arms "I could not, This is my own doing."

Arjay was unusually grave and replied stonily, "This is not your doing, obviously. The Vassal is dead, we are the last to have direct contact with them besides their staff. They believe one or more of us murdered the Vassal. Then there is the real problem." Ir cracked an ironic smirk, a touch of the Arjay sparkle returned, "The problem, compatriots, co-conspirators, is that we are still here, in these cells." The group all looked at the other's confinement as though a new truth could be found in it. "This means that they can't rule us out. This ship, it is a great spy apparatus. Every electronic communique can be intercepted, all traffic tracked, and crucially, there are cameras and sensors everywhere. Deep in the bowels of this beast, they can re-create in perfect detail a virtual construction of any part of the vessel at any time. The problem is that they can't see what happened, and such cannot discount any of us. This is a problem larger than the five of us in this room." 

Ir looked directly into Tavka's eyes for a moment longer than was accidental, snatched irs gaze back onto the other members and continued, "So no, it is certainly something to worry about."
