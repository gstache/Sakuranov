## The mystery outline:

The cruise will take two weeks. One week to the edge of the system gravity well where the ship will shift to the edge of the destination system, then one week to the destination planet. 
- After the first night, The Vassal is found dead in the arboretum, head cracked on a stone apparently having tripped. The cameras show the accident in full, Arjay is the last known person with the Vassal
- The Imperator blames Arjay because ir is foreign, and chafes at Ibanez being the lead investigator. Ibanez discovers the security footage has been tampered with. Without any additional leads and under pressure, Arjay is put in the ships brig.
- Ibanez interviews all the other dinner guests and establishes alibis, including for Arjay, but not for the Captain, leading to a release of Arjay. 
- Tavka is in the library with Anastasia and notices that they ordered the [drink name]
- Emmit discovers Arjay dying in the zero gravity steam room just a day after he was released. Arjay imparts a cryptic [drink name]. Again, there is tampered security footage, which again could only (at least to Ibanez) be the command staff
- Ibanez talks to Sirja, who relays the orders made in the intermediate time up to Arjay's death included the drink name, but the ID is missing
- Emmit and Tavka receive a dead man switch message from Arjay telling them who Anastasia really is and ir's suspicion that someone inside the ship is helping them do *something*, and together Emmit and Tavka attempt to tell Ibanez but the first officer intercepts.
- The Shift happens
- Sirja is found dead in their cradle, the captain is devastated. The first officer uses this as an opportunity to sideline Ibanez on the grounds of a failed investigation.
- The engine malfuctions after arriving to Mitsubesk, forcing a new orbital path that takes them close to an outer planet
- "Pirates" arrive and storm the ship (not depicted, Moloto uses his new security powers to confine the praetorians and misdirect the security team)
- The captain manages to sabotage the drive system and lockout control and sends Ibanez to try and rally the defense
- The private security team activates and joins the "pirates", fighting both the Praetorians and the ship security
- It all comes down to a final stand in the command center, as first officer moloto and the Daimyo AKA Anastasia try to get the captain to release the command lockout. They reveal their plan was to simply steal the ship, but with the drive system damaged, they will destroy the ship instead and wait for a [insert other empire] ship to pick them up
- Emmit and Tavka manage to subdue the pair and concludes the story

The ship has all the luxuries a modern society requires, including onsen with zero gravity steam room, shrines, fine dining, exercise facilities, simulation booths, high-end shopping, work spaces, a quiet section, as well as state of the art bio-parks that replicate three different biomes (mediterranean, tropical, borreal)

	- The captain is delayed by an engine repair, and must apologize to the vassal who issues a threat
	- Emmit takes Tavka to get food, and Arjay meets them, introduces Anastasia and informs them they are invited to the captains for dinner
2.
	- Sirja (Captain Perspective) begins preparations for the formal dinner, introducing us to both the captain of the guard, the head of ship security, and their own idiosyncrasies
	- Tavka (tav perspective) arrives at dinner, the first to do so. Light conversation with the captain and first officer moloto, other guests arrive. Notably, nothing is served and an hour or more passes until the vassal arrives, making a sideways comment to the captain about "being kept waiting". Service begins, The Vassal is lively and catty, but particularly fond of Arjay, whom she refers to as "The little Raja's eyes" Arjay brings up Emmit's service as a distraction, captain points out moloto's service as well. It turns out that they served in the same campaign, which Emmit refers to as "a waste of lives" triggering an enraged outburst from Moloto
	- Emmit has taken this quite personally, and an argument ensues, leading to Moloto storming out of the dinner in a tremendous breach of protocol. The captain desperately tries to reign things in, but the Vassal is amused and insists dinner continue. While Anastasia insists the campaign was necessary for some factor of realpolitik, Tavka joins in to identify the resources expended and anastasia corrects him, potentially revealing their identity. As dinner concludes, Arjay invites the vassal to walk in the arboretum
