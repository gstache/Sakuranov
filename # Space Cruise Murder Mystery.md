## The mystery outline:

The cruise will take two weeks. One week to the edge of the system gravity well where the ship will shift to the edge of the destination system, then one week to the destination planet. After the first night, The Vassal is found dead in the arboretum, head cracked on a stone apparently having tripped. The cameras show the accident in full. After another two days, the chief steward is found dead in the zero gravity onsen. No cameras are in the onsen, and the cameras in the hall show no other people entering. The steward was carrying a specific drink, but no orders are found in the system. The only people logged into the system at the time are the captain, and two of the staff leaders. The cargo and 1200 passengers require the journey continue, but tensions escalate and the first officer's investigation seems to point to the captain. The shift happens, but once everyone wakes back up the diplomat is now dead in ir cradle. After investigating, the bureaucrat and soldier come to a conclusion when the soldier notices the same drink is ordered by the mysterious tourist, and the bureaucrat discovers the first officer has the captain's clearance codes. The Mysterious tourist is in fact a Daimyo, below a vassal, but with several critical holdings on the edge of imperial space. The first officer has arranged a pirate raid to spirit the daimyo away to a rival empire and secure his own position as captain after the captain's tragic death at the hands of the pirates, which of course will now have to include the destruction of the entire ship, if the bureaucrat and soldier can't stop it from happening.

## The Ship

The CS Sakuranov is one of the Hokkido Line's newest Lotus-Class interstellar liners. Fit to accommodate 2000 passengers, with a crew and staff of 250, she measures 1 kilometer stem to stern. The main fusion rockets are separated from the habitation sections by a wide shield shaped like lotus petals towards the stern. The habitable sections are arranged forward of the shield in petals, surrounding the shift core. A lattice of supports and elevators connects the three strands, which contain a variety of amenities and cabins, arranged around open midways. The ship has all the luxuries a modern society requires, including onsen with zero gravity steam room, shrines, fine dining, exercise facilities, simulation booths, high-end shopping, work spaces, a quiet section, as well as state of the art bio-parks that replicate three different biomes (mediterranean, tropical, borreal)
- staff uniforms: rose and gold
- Officer uniforms: white with rose and gold accents

- Bar Jinbei (deck 6)

	- Emmit takes Tavka to get food, and Arjay meets them, introduces Anastasia and informs them they are invited to the captains for dinner
2.
	- Sirja (Captain Perspective) begins preparations for the formal dinner, introducing us to both the captain of the guard, the head of ship security, and their own idiosyncrasies
	- Tavka (tav perspective) wastes some time in their room, reading news reports about agronomy and crucially a rash of piracy, when they finally receive the formal invitation to dinner and has a mild panic about what to wear  Tavka arrives at dinner, the first to do so. Light conversation with the captain and first officer moloto, other guests arrive. Notably, nothing is served and an hour or more passes until the vassal arrives, making a sideways comment to the captain about "being kept waiting". Service begins, The Vassal is lively and catty, but particularly fond of Arjay, whom she refers to as "The little Raja's eyes" Arjay brings up Emmit's service as a distraction, captain points out moloto's service as well. It turns out that they served in the same campaign, which Emmit refers to as "a waste of lives" triggering an enraged outburst from Moloto
	- Emmit has taken this quite personally, and an argument ensues, leading to Moloto storming out of the dinner in a tremendous breach of protocol. The captain desperately tries to reign things in, but the Vassal is amused and insists dinner continue. While Anastasia insists the campaign was necessary for some factor of realpolitik, Tavka joins in to identify the resources expended and anastasia corrects him, potentially revealing their identity. As dinner concludes, Arjay invites the vassal to walk in the arboretum
