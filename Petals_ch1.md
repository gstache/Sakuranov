## Chapter One: An Ensemble Assembles

"This necessarily implies that half the Anzhalt army is in trousers and the other is in frocks, do I have that correct?" a Gujranya traveler bedazzled in a series of increasingly gilded linens asked.

"Not exactly: they don't permit the female-type - apologies - *women* - they don't allow them to join." an Eienvechni dressed in a three piece robe with a rakish collar that highlighted their strong jawline corrected.

"Absurd! Barbaric even. I thought you Eienvechni were an odd bunch with your theys and thems, I couldn't possibly imagine submitting to a system so rigidly divided."

Tavka stared straight ahead past the chattering pair down the boarding tube, looking at nothing in particular. They had been subjected to a series of inane conversations while floating in line, desperately holding in their lunch from both micro gravity and irritation. Boarding should have begun nearly an hour ago and the extra time had not been kind to their delicate gravity-loving insides. The Eienvechni nudged Tavka with their surprisingly firm arm, nearly expelling Tavka's lunch, then playfully gestured at the Gujranya.

"Can you believe what he just said about us! A bit rude for a visitor, am I right?" 

Tavka was momentarily stunned, their periwinkle eyes wide, "I hadn't-"

"RUDE?" Erupted the Gujranya in mock outrage "*HE*?" His eyes twinkled and curls bounced playfully in the low gravity as he corrected them:

"My ungendered companions, I would never select such an outlier for my own sobriquet. I have crafted the perfect *ir*, just a few shades to the feminine of *HE*"

Tavka was freed again from participation as the Eienvechni re-engaged the conversation with inquiries about the difference in various Gujranya genders. They looked out the small porthole into space and at the station that spun quietly below them, or besides them, or was it above them? The entire concept of zero-g was vertigo inducing. They focused instead on the bulk of the ship that stretched out to the stars. They must be looking toward the bow, they decided, as the white and rose gold paneling came to a glittering point and no engines were visible. This reverie was once more interrupted, this time by the Gujranya:

"You wouldn't happen to know why we are so delayed, would you?"

"No, I'm very sorry" They responded politely.

"Ah, never the less. OH! A thousand apologies upon the Hierarch, I have been so *rude*" another knowing glance at ir's new acquaintance "My name is Arjun Santiago de Ascension de Ramaya, second attache to the honored consular for the Korido domain, representative of His Majesty's Raj,  but you both can call me Arjay. With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?"

"Well, I'll go first since you've been annoying me the longest. Sargent Emmit Raskido, retired of the Hierarch's service, may they guide me still" With a remarkably canine grin, they turned to Tavka "What about our slight friend? Who are you?"

This was entirely too forward, but protocol would not permit them to disclaim as such. Additionally, they did not appreciate being described as slight. Trim, possibly, but slight seemed intentionally provocative from the more robust Emmit.

"Tavka Itovanov" they said with a slight bow which sent them into a tumble. Emmit gave them a deft push to counter the spin "Is this your first time traveling interstellar?" they asked.

"It's my first time traveling off-planet at all, and thank you for stopping my spin."

"It happens to everyone the first time." Emmit said with a twinkle.

"Well, *Eternal* Tavka," Arjay interjected with a mock honorific, "What brings you to the very edge of the Korido domain?"

"I'm being transferred to serve as a logistics supervisor at the agricultural directorate on Sano"

"Tremendous, suitably boring. What about you, my other epicine traveler?"

"I've got a little saved up from my service, and I've purchased a mining claim, ironically-" here Emmit nodded at Tavka "-on the third moon of Sano."

"Fortune seeking! Brava! Now if only we could seek our fortune on this ship forthwith."
Unfortunately for Tavka, Emmit, and Arjay, boarding would be delayed further still.

The weight of three thousand souls has never lessened even after ninety-nine trips, Captain Zhukarwa thought to themselves. Right now they felt the strain acutely as they were critically behind schedule. The CS Sakuranov was brand new and had just returned from its space worthiness trials, unfortunately with a critical failure in the third fusion rocket. As usual, one problem which appeared to be as simple as a broken impeller cascaded to the point that an entirely new fusion core would need to be installed. This was now complete if late, and all that remained was a rigorous check to ensure the safety and functionality. Any missed step, any failure to identify and resolve problems now could have consequences ranging from being stranded in space to total annihilation. They rubbed their greying temple and reflexively checked their high, short ponytail which remained in place despite all the floating around they had been up to. As one of the engineers read off another crucial result, a cool breeze tickled their neck hair which meant someone had entered into the compartment. They recognized the volume of air immediately as their first officer and rotated themselves around to chastise them for being in the wrong place.

"Officer Moloto, should you not be overseeing the security of our boarding operations?"

"Apologies Honored Captain, but the Vassal has arrived"

Zhukarwa's wind was sucked from their lungs. By the Hierarch! They were late to accept the Vassal of the entire Korido domain, to whom mechanical failures would not be a suitable excuse, and they were reminded of it by their subordinate, all of which was completely unacceptable in Zhukarwa's carefully controlled world.

"We have also placed boarding on hold until the Vassal is embarked"

Not only were they in serious breach of protocol, but there were now two thousand five hundred passengers growing more impatient and motion sick in the boarding tubes. In addition they might miss their orbital rendezvous window which would add another five days, all in zero gravity instead of the one gravity of acceleration.

"May the Hierarch show mercy upon us" The captain sighed "Moloto, I empower you to complete this inspection. Have the report prepared in detail so I may review it before we engage the engines." 

"Yes Honored." Moloto offered a crisp salute and floated past the captain to speak with the engineer and Zhukarwa pushed themselves out and to the VIP boarding tube as quickly as physics would allow: they had some grovelling to do.

What awaited would sear itself into their dreams for the rest of their lives. Just ahead of the airlock stood their Chief Steward, the enigmatic, bald Sirja, their feet anchored to the floor with magnetic boots and a placid expression the captain recognized as profound embarrassment. The cause of this embarrassment was opposite of them: a phalanx of twelve praetorian guards in blood red laced with deep evergreen surrounding the frowning Vassal who stood on a floating gravity pad, and their herald floating in stately orange robes. The gravity pad was one of four in existence, an unimaginable expense. Zhukarwa shot to the floor, pressing themselves as flat as possible and with eyes lowered they begged,

"Oh Eternal Vassal, Hand of the Hierarch, Scepter of Authority and Peace, I beseech unto you your forgiveness and mercy for my unacceptable delay!"

The Vassal narrowed their eyes and clicked their teeth. The herald responded with a sonorous baritone that shook the very fabric of space and time:

"The Vassal, Mibu of the House Tokogawlsi, Landarch of Korido, Under *Whom* Twenty Billion Souls live beneath the glory of *their* 13 suns on *their* 14 planets and uncountable smaller stellar bodies, expresses their most extreme displeasure at having been inconvenienced."

"My most complete and heartfelt apologies Eternal Vassal Mibu, Autarch of Austranov, Sovereign of Sano, Hand -" They were briskly interrupted by The Vassal:

"Oh shut up. Enough, enough, enough, we've wasted enough of my time. Get off the floor Captain"

Zhukarwa flicked upright with a single wrist flick, stopping their backward rotation with their big toe, eyes still on the floor.

"I am extremely annoyed! I'm not entirely unreasonable or un-merciful: I know about the mechanical issues as relayed by your excellent steward, but not withstanding this, you have committed a grave insult against the Hierarchy as represented by Me and it cannot go un-punished." the captain continued to stare a hole through the floor. 

"So!" Mibu clapped their hands and the frown eased "I will wait until we arrive to decide whether I recommend your immediate dismissal without honor, or simply reduce your retired rank to an executive officer. Wonderful, so glad that unpleasant business is concluded. After all these many years, your patience really does increase, doesn't it?" They directed this toward their herald, who nodded enthusiastically.

"Well then captain" Mibu smiled with a wink, "Aren't you going to welcome me aboard?"

Emmit floated through the vast atrium toward the cabin decks, guided intermittently by staff in crisp rose and gold pajamas. The ship was divided into three "petals", vertical curved structures rising from a central bio-dome. The bio-dome contained several distinct environments for passengers, multiple beaches, and an arboretum at the base of each petal. The petals themselves reflected the conditions of the arboretum they emerged from, from a warm and humid tropical, a temperate autumnal, and a dry seaside summer, which Emmit had selected. The gentle air caressed their collar, inviting them to the beach below as they were shepherded towards a cabin deck. 

The overly wound apparatchik they had conversed with earlier seemed on the verge of puking, but Emmit quite enjoyed their time in micro gravity as it relieved the ever present joint pain from ten years of fighting the Hierarchy's battles. Relaxation was the order of this voyage, and they would make full use of all the facilities the ship had to offer. As one of the stewards guided them into the seating pod by their cabin door they wondered what would become of that slim nerd with the golden tufts and the amusing diplomat, and hoped to see at least one of them again in more detail. Their hopes were partially answered as Tavka was led to the cabin opposite Emmit's. Greener than they were in the boarding tube and wearing an scrunched expression somewhere between frustration and nausea, they were strapped into the pod. Emmit caught their attention with a small wave, which they returned with a  pained nod. As guests continued to trickle past, Emmit said,

"I have a magic cure for gravity sickness"

"Is it gravity?" Tavka replied, drawing a chuckle from Emmit,

"Ha! No, once we reach G, come with me to the Bar Jinbei on deck 6, my treat. I saw it on the way up."

They could see Tavka's desire for isolation and their politeness wage war across their face and offered an out,

"It's not an order, you can't hurt my feelings by saying no" This was not exactly true. Tavka began to reply and was interrupted by the ship-wide whistle and announcement,

"Well I-"

"Good Evening Honored Guests of the Hokkido Line Ship CS Sakuranov. I am your captain, Zhukarwa. In a few moments we will be pushed off our moorings and will begin the acceleration phase of our journey. After six days under one standard gravity of acceleration, we will reach the edge of the system where we will shift to the Mitsubesk system, and begin our six day deceleration to Moskva Station. The crew and staff will take excellent care of you as we travel, please don't hesitate to ask for any assistance." The whistle sounded again and the entire ship shuddered as the thrusters pushed it away from Edo station.
Tavka regained their composure,

"I would like any remedy for this discomfort"

Emmit grinned that same canine grin from the boarding tube.

"You won't regret it"

The ship's engines rumbled to life, pressing the travelers into their chairs with slowly increasing force until the force reached one gravity. A surge of excitement raced up Emmit's spine as the acceleration compressed them. This had always been their favorite part of expeditions, feeling the surge of millions of tons of steel spurred on by the fusion output of a small sun. It was a feeling that lived deep in their gut, a sense of urgency and power a far cry from the grim tedium that awaited at the end of those previous journeys. Another whistle sounded and a new voice announced that it was safe to move about the ship, and Emmit beckoned Tavka follow them.

After a brief ramble, followed by an elevator ride and some minor confusion about where exactly the Bar Jinbei was on the 6th deck, the pair found Emmit's magic cure and a table that looked out past the balcony of the bar. Below them was the promenade which extended a little further out into the atrium which soared ten decks above them and fell another five below to their petal's arboretum. The wall opposite the bar was entirely transparent, affording a view of the glittering golden shift core and the other petals of the ship.

Tavka's color returned as they ate, but would remain several shades paler than Emmit despite the sustenance.

"It's bambam root" Emmit said "Don't ask me what the compound is, but it has an anti nausea effect. Also, it's delicious fried with an herb sauce"

"Rather like a turnip cake"

"Yes! But better" Emmit took a draft of their cocktail, a mix of some brown liquor they were previously unaware of and calevine syrup, a tart, sharp combination that burned pleasantly. Their eyes once more fell on Tavka, who no longer looked as fragile. Their tufts of blonde had settled into small short waves on top of their head, shaved on the side which accented their narrow jawline. Following the line down their slender neck to a knife-sharp collarbone and narrow, sinewy shoulders Emmit began to appreciate their tautness, and with the help of the alcohol wonder what else could be hiding under that grey tunic. 

Their musings were cut short by the unmistakable tenor of Arjay:
"My androgynous *amigos*! I'm so glad I've run into you once again." Tavka did not look glad, but Emmit enjoyed teasing ir and retorted "I didn't realize you would have selected this petal, I assumed you people preferred the humidity"

"*You People*. Typical Eienvechni xenophobia. I take great personal offense!" Arjay said mockingly "This Mediterranean clime suits me perfectly. We are not a monolith! Regardless, I have met someone quite interesting" Ir gestured to the short person next to them in a stylish bob "This is Anastasia, a military historian of profound depth, who I was just having a fascinating, nay, enlightening conversation with before I saw my two friends." Anastasia bowed politely, Arjay continued: "I also bring an invitation. I have been invited to dine with the captain tonight and insisted that you all be included."

Emmit and Tavka looked at each other, Tavka's eyes wide, their hand raising to protest, and Emmit said "Why not? I'm sure the food is excellent."
