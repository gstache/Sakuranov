## Chapter 3: A Death Among The Trees
---

The warm light reflected off of the shift core and onto Emmit's copper skin as they reclined on the sand beach. A cooling breeze from the salty ocean-style pool gently tousled their dark hair and rustled the purple leaves of the Ionean olive trees which grew from between the blush pink standstone outcroppings that lined the edge of the beach area. Waves lapped up the sound of other passengers enjoying the bio-dome. Emmit waved down a steward and ordered one of those calevine cocktails with the enlivening 'whisky' and relished their decision to have spent the extra scrip to travel on the *Sakuranov*. They could be on a much cheaper worker freighter, lucky to have even the windowless cabin they had now, eating nutri-paste and amusing themselves by identifying their fellow passengers by smell. 

They closed their eyes and soaked up the artificial sun, their mind pleasantly drifting from relaxing sensation to another. Until, as it had since last night, returning to that absolutely contemptible, self important first officer. An ugly part of their subconscious was insisting that they could just punch the reprobate square in the face, and no one would care particularly much. The sneer, those eyes looking down their nose at Emmit as they stormed out of dinner (like a coward), all could be re-arranged with strategic violence. They also didn't particularly enjoy being used as entertainment. Arjay was both the charmer and the snake, and Emmit had gotten bit. At least the apparatchik Tavka had been entrapped with them, small comfort as that was. The look on their face when Emmit pointed to their eye was unforgettable and very amusing. The choice of a periwinkle wrap hadn't been intentional, they just liked how it looked in the soft light of their cabin. They just couldn't resist toying with Tavka, when they realized the dress matched their eyes (which were startling) they felt a libidinal urge to play with their emotions. Just a little, or maybe they wanted their attention. Maybe they would run into them again in front of their neighboring cabin and they could see if they wanted to get to know Emmit a little better, after some drinks and dancing. They probably didn't dance, Emmit thought.

"Rasky!" A voice cut through the waves and wind like the bow of a ship "Nice tits!"
