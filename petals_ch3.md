## Chapter 3: A Reunion, A Fall, An Alarm
---

The warm light reflected off of the shift core and onto Emmit's copper skin as they reclined on the sand beach. A cooling breeze from the salty ocean-style pool gently tousled their dark hair and rustled the purple leaves of the Ionian olive trees which grew from between the blush pink sandstone outcroppings that lined the edge of the beach area. Waves lapped up the sound of other passengers enjoying the bio-dome. Emmit waved down a steward and ordered one of those calevine cocktails with the enlivening 'whisky' and relished their decision to have spent the extra scrip to travel on the *Sakuranov*. They could be on a much cheaper worker freighter, lucky to have even the windowless cabin they had now, eating nutri-paste and amusing themselves by identifying their fellow passengers by smell. 

They closed their eyes and soaked up the artificial sun, their mind pleasantly drifting from relaxing sensation to another. Until, as it had since last night, returning to that absolutely contemptible, self important first officer. An ugly part of their subconscious was insisting that they could just punch the reprobate square in the face, and no one would care particularly much. The sneer, those eyes looking down their nose at Emmit as they stormed out of dinner (like a coward), all could be re-arranged with strategic violence. They also didn't particularly enjoy being used as entertainment. Arjay was both the charmer and the snake, and Emmit had gotten bit. At least the apparatchik Tavka had been entrapped with them, small comfort as that was. The look on their face when Emmit pointed to their eye was unforgettable and very amusing. The choice of a periwinkle wrap hadn't been intentional, they just liked how it looked in the soft light of their cabin. They just couldn't resist toying with Tavka, when they realized the dress matched their eyes (which were startling) they felt a libidinal urge to play with their emotions. Just a little, or maybe they wanted their attention. Maybe they would run into them again in front of their neighboring cabin and they could see if they wanted to get to know Emmit a little better, after some drinks and dancing. They probably didn't dance, Emmit thought.

"Rasky!" A voice cut through the waves and wind like the bow of a ship "Nice tits!"

Tavka reclined in the sleeping alcove of their cabin. It wasn't large, it was windowless, but the materials were soothing natural tones and the lights were warm and indirect. The effect was comforting and quiet, perfect to cocoon in. Tavka held their tablet to their chest as they skimmed some headlines. Pirate activity in some Korido systems, that didn't inspire confidence. Some singer died, shame. Below the fold, a small update caught their attention: 'Search continues for missing Daimyo Fujschev'. The continued reading: 'Authorities have continued to expand the search radius in the Harkondon system following the disappearance of Daimyo Fujschev. The Daimyo was traveling aboard a private yacht. System authorities recorded a fusion explosion three weeks ago along the yacht's orbital plan, but have yet to find any survival pods or wreckage. The Daimyo has served faithfully...' They stopped reading there, they didn't need a hagiography of a most likely dead warlord. They remembered seeing some news about the incident when it happened, but had totally forgotten. Hierarchy politics were not something that concerned them very much, seeing as they had risen as far as they were likely to politically with this new posting on Sano. Still, it was another coincidence; they had just survived an incredibly tense dinner where Fujschev was the locus of disagreement. Not just that, but it was as though this was orchestrated by Arjay, who may or may not be more than a humble consular attache.

The last dismissive comment from Anastasia resurfaced and rattled around Tavka's brain. "The Basics". They had given a halfhearted defense of the noxious (at least to Tavka) idea that there had been subterfuge by radicals connected to foreign interlopers, maybe they didn't understand the basics! It doesn't matter how illustrious your education, you can still fall victim to conspiracy theories, Tavka thought smugly. On second thought, however, maybe this was a different sign. Could their inclusion by Arjay have been a signal? Bringing Anastasia into a conversation about the war with veterans and a Vassal, ir might have been conducting a test. Ir could truly be a spy, and this was a rouse to flush out another spy's cover! Excitedly, Tavka accessed the archive of Sentaku university, specifically searching for Anastasia. To their disappointment, they found a brief biography, several listed publications, and a roster of classes they had taught as a graduate student. To be absolutely certain, they tried to load a published paper and their file photo, but these were not readily available on the ship's information system. They would have to wait a few hours while their request signal reached Harkondon and returned before they could learn more.

They placed the tablet down on the bed next to them and resolved to find an activity that would drag them out of the room. This required picking the tablet back up, which made Tavka feel foolish. Searching through the catalogue of options, one stood out: a bouldering park in the Mediterranean petal. About twenty minutes later, they stood at the base of a challenging problem, plotting their solution while the cool breeze from the artificial sea prickled the hairs on their neck. The crag started with a slab approximately three meters which turned into a brief overhang and finished with an acrobatic crux in a vertical transition, and Tavka was absolutely stoked. 

They tossed down the arrestor pod, chalked their hands, and assumed the backstep starting position. They carefully worked their way up the route, fingers and feet more confident with each move up the slab. Then the overhand, forearms burning, abs engaged, hips pressed flush to the rock, the whole world vanished. They were flowing now, not climbing, every hold pre calculated, mind empty except for their breath. They crested the transition back to vertical and got a closer look at the crux. From where they approached, they would have to make a single leap from a crimp. Fortunately, the final hold before the apex was a large chicken-head outcrop which they could grab with both hands. They took a moment to look out at the bio-dome. Just past the crags was the beach, ringed by purple olive trees and blue palms and the artificial sea. The shift core seemed to rise from the sea, a golden egg. The bio-dome curved around it, dark green fir trees to the left and a profusion of chrome yellow Hyperion jungle to the right. On the beach below, sun bathers reclined, topless as a rule. A familiar set of curls caught their eye: Emmit was relaxed on chaise with unsurprisingly a drink. What was surprising to Tavka was the person standing next to them. Impressively sized, heavily muscled, and still bearing the suit shunts in their shoulders, neck, and chest, this must be a soldier. They had Emmit's full attention, and a heat began building in Tavka. Jealousy? They hardly knew them, what's there to be jealous of, they thought. It was best to put it out of their mind and re-center, re-focus on the final leap.

They sat into their hips, tensed their legs, and leaped. For a moment they were fully flying thirty meters above the sand, fingers outstretched. Time stopped. Visions flashed before them. Sun filtering through brown hair, mahogany, amber and ocher. The high cut line of Emmit's bathing suit tracing their hips. Their tricep flexing as they gestured. The wink in a periwinkle dress. The golden light reflecting off of the shift core onto their chest, nipples stiff in the breeze. Time sped back up as Tavka's hands made contact with the outcrop. The contact was briefly secured, until it wasn't, and Tavka slipped. Fifteen meters they fell, stomach rising until the arrestor pod snapped into action and deployed the aero-gel pad to catch the falling apparatchik. Tavka deflated along with the gel.
