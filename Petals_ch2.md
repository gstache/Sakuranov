## Chapter 2: A Disastrous Dinner
---

Captain Zhukarwa sat at the head of the executive dining table with their head in their hands. Their fate now rested on a dinner with a mercurial overlord, a situation they had spent their whole career successfully avoiding. One late arrival, however, would be enough to undo several decades of scrupulous work and an unblemished record as a captain. Fate could be cruel. This affair had taken them from the bridge and forced them to leave Moloto in command for the afternoon, which they didn't particularly care for. Moloto's record was excellent, but they exuded an untrustworthy smarm, and this was the first trip as Zhukarwa's first officer. 

Their self pity was interrupted by the soft chime of the doorbell. Presentation was paramount, they sat upright and smoothed their hair into its normal precise arrangement. "You may enter"

Sirja glided into the dining room and sat askance of the captain with a crisp adjustment of their white steward sash over their rose robes. Their golden brown eyes met the captains and stole Zhukarwa's breath as they had for nearly ten years. The captain's face relaxed ever so slightly as Sirja updated them on the status of service aboard the ship. The subject then turned to the dinner to be served this evening:

"I don't need to tell you how important this is" Zhukarwa began "Another mis-step, any breach in protocol, any disfavor or slight and I'll lose everything. I'll be working in a scullery until I die without my pension, you know"

"I have everything in hand" Sirja reassured them "The menu is set, the staff is briefed, all will be well"

"I hope you are right" The captain sighed. Sirja reached forward and gently took their hand.

"Viseli," The captain's rigid posture melted at their seldom used first name, "I have everything in hand. Besides, even if you lose your pension, we can still live off of mine. I also know of Mibu's style both from personal experience and gossip amongst the other stewards, and I say with confidence that you have nothing to worry about. They make a big show to keep up appearances"

"I hope you are right, baldy" The pet name evinced a spectacular eye roll, even if it was accurate. Viseli enjoyed a little jest at his unflappable partner. They reached to take Sirja's other hand but stopped. A new commotion was brewing outside the dining room and was clearly on its way inside.

Without knocking and mid argument, First officer Moloto, the head of security Ibanez and the Imperator of the Vassal's Praetorian Guard barged into the dining room. Zhukarwa raised his hand to silence the trio, and then pointed to Moloto "Please explain the nature of the disagreement"

Moloto stood at attention and replied briskly "These two are undermining my authority with regards to this evenings security arrangements. Both insist on taking priority but work so sensitive requires the highest possible level of rank to oversee"

"Which is why I'm now being involved, *honored commander*?" The captain replied icily with extra emphasis on the honorific.

"My apologies, Honored Captain" Moloto bowed stiffly, "In essence, the answer is yes. I am the first officer, I should handle security for the captain directly and they should respond as my subordinates."

"In essence you should learn to delegate more effectively" Zhukarwa delivered the barb pointedly. Moloto was in general a highly competent officer, but their ambition exceeded their grace. "You should also not have left your station on the bridge, which we will deal with later. Ibanez, what is your concern?"

"We can't effectively oversee ship security without cooperation from the Imperator and their guards. Our team is being prohibited from accessing spaces where Praetorians are on patrol, and the Imperator wants no ship security at tonight's dinner. This is our ship, my responsibility, and my team is completely vetted! We are not a risk!"

The Imperator shot him a cutting glare "I am solely responsible for the safety of the Vassal, Hand of the Hierarch, The Sun that Shines on the Grateful Citizens of Korido, and I will take no chances."

Captain Zhukarwa stood up and pressed both their hands firmly on the table in front of them. Gravitas manifests as a physical force in certain people, and Viseli had enough to pull the attention of everyone present without a word. The Imperator in red, Ibanez in security grey and gold and Moloto in officer white were as statues. The captain let the moment drag until they were satisfied that they had built up enough psychic weight, and issued their verdict:

"Ibanez, the Imperator will handle security this evening. If the Vassal is in a room that room is the domain of the Vassal and that settles the matter. Honored Imperator: while your praetorians are on my ship, they will not interfere with my security personnel. You *will* provide Ibanez's team with all access they request with the exception being the immediate personal space of the vassal. They are not your enemy or a threat, work with them to extend your protection. Officer Moloto: you will handle all further conflicts regarding this issue, but allow Ibanez to perform his duties, they need not become your own."

"With all due respect, honored captain, any foreigner may be an immediate threat" The Imperator stated bluntly, firmly focused on Ibanez. 

"I trust my crew with my life, they trust me with theirs. That is all you need for reassurance. You are all dismissed."

The Imperator marched out brusquely, followed by a grumbling Ibanez. Sirja and Moloto reached the door at the same time and Moloto attempted to say something they believed out of the captain's earshot. Zhukarwa caught the last bit "-but I'm not protected by a *special relationship* with the captain". Sirja stared at Moloto with their usual inscrutable expression as Moloto stomped down the hall. Sirja and Viseli locked eyes again for a moment and Viseli sighed.

They should have declined the invitation, Tavka decided as they stepped into the elevator. This event was so far beyond their station that they could feel themselves getting smaller as the elevator raced upwards. Nervousness had always snarled itself around their life and preparing for dinner with the captain of a flagship inter-stellar cruise liner was fertile soil for the noxious vine. It had taken nearly two hours and six different outfit choices to settle on the high collared oyster shell and silver robe they currently were fidgeting with. They had tried out a brighter color, but the possibility they might upstage one of the more esteemed guests was mortifying. A deep-necked lace number had struck their fancy in the shop planetside as it showcased their graceful, narrow chest. Immensely satisfying in the mirror, it however prevented them from even attempting to leave the cabin. 

The elevator slowed and the doors slid open to the foyer of the executive dining room. Rich, warm, real wood floors, a spectacular double spiral staircase of mother of pearl and slate, and tapestries depicting the three thousand year history of the Hierarchy greeted Tavka along with half a dozen red-robed and unusually tall people. "Please step forward" the person closest to the elevator ordered. "Spread your arms and legs" Two more stepped forward and proceeded to thoroughly pat down Tavka. Then a third approached with a hand-held scanner. Recognition hit Tavka as a rogue wave: these were Hierarchic Praetorians. The red robes trimmed in forest green, the swords and elegant pistols upon which watchful hands rested, they had seen them only on their tablet in news reports. Their worst fears about this dinner were confirmed, they would be a complete social outsider. Dread followed each step up the stairs and stalled their hand at the doorbell. Fortunately or not, the door slid open without input. A dark, bald person in the finest rose colored robe  that Tavka had ever seen, tied with a mother of pearl belt sash, bowed deeply to them and invited them inside.

"Welcome Honored guest Tavka. I am chief steward Sirja and will handle any needs you may have this evening. It is my singular pleasure to introduce you to our Honored captain, Viseli Zhukarwa" They extended a white gloved hand with a flourish toward the person standing at the head of the table. The captain gave Tavka a short, polite bow which Tavka returned deeply, marveling at the poise with which the captain had adjusted their golden command sash over their white tunic. They all stood for an awkward moment while Tavka took in the view of the stars through the arched windows over the table, finally remembering that they should probably say something,

"It is an honor to meet you both" Tavka said with another deep bow. Not completely sure where to stand, they sidled over to the left of the table and stood patiently, hoping something or someone would take the spotlight. They didn't have to wait long, as the door opened to reveal Arjay. Ir wore loose black linen pants with gold piping, a crimson silk blouse and a black vest positively dripping with golden filigree. The same formal greeting was met with one of ir's characteristically loquacious rejoinders, and ir gave a most extravagant bow to the captain. After ir, the historian Anastasia in a conservative set of charcoal robes, followed by Emmit in, of all colors, periwinkle. Post greeting, they gave Tavka a little wave and pointed to their eye, and a electric tingle shot up Tavka's spine. Were they playing a game, dressing in the same color as Tavka's eyes, and Tavka wondered if maybe they should play along. Perhaps, they thought, but this was too forward for them under normal circumstances and these conditions were far from normal. 

Further contemplation was interrupted by the captain: "Thank you all for coming at the behest of our VIP guest" Tavka and Emmit locked eyes for a moment, and Tavka was sure the same thought was crossing their mind, hadn't their invitation come from Arjay? Was he the VIP? Most likely not. "I also thank you for your patience while we await their arrival". They whispered something to the steward Sirja, but Tavka's attention was grabbed by Anastasia's approach. They greeted them with a short courteous nod and Anastasia said "It is good to see you again, and I'm sorry for not introducing myself properly at our first meeting. Anastasia, pleased to meet your honored acquaintance." 

Their dark bob framed a well-defined set of cheekbones and eyes so black they reflected the stars from the overhead window. Tavka could feel themselves being drawn in. "I'm Tavka, the pleasure is mine" a moment lapsed, then Tavka remembered that Arjay had introduced them as a historian, "Arjay said you were a historian?"

"Yes, although I'm still undertaking my doctorate. I have accepted a temporary position at the Hierarch's College on Sano while I complete my thesis."

The Hierarch's College is a tremendously prestigious posting on any world (although some would say that The Forum or Sentaku University were more so), so this Anastasia must be a serious academic, Tavka thought. In an effort not to appear provincial, they inquired further, "What is your field?"

"My dissertation is focused on the third Anzhalt war"

"That was barely five years ago, isn't that too recent for 'history'?"

They laughed and gave their bob a little flip, "Not at all, there are so many primary sources right now, so many experiences to draw upon."

Arjay sauntered over and put ir arm around Anastasia's shoulders and addressed Tavka, "This one is just full of information, aren't they?" With a flourish of ir blouse, ir released Anastasia and turned them to face ir. "I hope you'll regale our most eternal guest with your historiography of the Anzhalt flare up, they will be thrilled. As a bonus, I have also invited a veteran of that very conflict for you to have a tet a tet with"

Anastasia smiled, but Tavka noticed the smile did not extend to their eyes. They also assumed Arjay was referring to Emmit, being the only person in the room that they knew to be a veteran, but how did ir know that they were in that war? Each small occurrence on their own may be pure coincidence, but two coincidences together make a puzzle, and Tavka could not resist a puzzle. They asked Arjay, "You've invited some interesting people, and me. Why me?"

"To be perfectly direct my dear grey Tavka, it would have been rude to invite just Emmit when you were sitting right there"

That stung Tavka. Grey Tavka, once again. They withdrew to the edge of the room, watching others converse, stewing in a combination of anxiety and self-pity. Eventually, the conversations began to die out as the conspicuous lack of both food and drink weighed on the assembled persons. Like thunder over the plains of Tarkus a voice erupted from the doorway, the loudest human voice Tavka had ever heard,

"MAKE WAY, MAKE WAY AND BOW BEFORE THE ETERNAL VASSAL." A person in flaming orange robes strode into the room and continued bellowing, "Their Eternal Honor Mibu Tokogawlsi Arrives; the fusion core of thirteen suns are fueled by their passion, their sweat falls as rain to the people of the fertile and prosperous Korido Domain, their words are the sweetest succor to the most fallen vagrant, bow and seek mercy!"

The assembled bowed, mostly from the sheer volume, as a small, elderly person entered the dining room. They wore a green three piece suit with a crimson cravat and a jaunty crimson pill box hat. With the slightest flick of their wrist, they dismissed their herald, and summoned the dinner guests to rise from their bows.

"See, being delayed is very, *very* annoying, is it not?" They asked the room. There were a few polite chuckles but the captain looked like they had bit into a lemon, "I will say, you all look very dashing. Now, let's get to the goods! Sirja, drinks!"

Sirja and their staff moved through the guests, delivering a constellation of exotic libations. Tavka received a yuzu and plum wine spritz, Emmit a whisky of some kind, and they noticed a glowing blue drink in Anastasia's hand. Tavka hadn't made any request, had no idea what "Yuzu" even was, but one tentative sip confirmed that this was their new favorite. Along with the fizz, they felt the warm discomfort of being known. The Vassal then summoned all eyes with a single raised hand.

"Before we take our seats, let us take a moment to glorify our Eternal Hierarch." They cleared their throat and began the Eien-Vecchny Liturgy, which contained the usual key points: The Hierarch is the sun around which the body politic orbits, only through their beneficence do all Eienvechni live, everything held in its place, and a place for everything, et cetera. The other guests intoned along, except for Arjay. "...And may their blessed eyes yet see the glorious sun rise of the future evermore. By the Hierarch!" Mibu enthusiastically thrust their drink skyward, spilled a little, and then downed it in one swift quaff. The performance was so distracting that Tavka didn't notice the first officer enter and stand next to the captain. They were nearly a head taller than the captain, but retained the presence of a smaller person. 

The vassal took their seat and the guests followed in class order: Arjay first, the Captain second, and the rest third (although Tavka could have sworn that Anastasia flinched toward their chair with Arjay). Sirja and their staff brought a first course, then a second. Exotic fishes prepared as nigiri, carpaccio, tartare, a salad of fruits Tavka had never seen was met with the vassal's enthusiastic approval. Emmit had been correct: the food was excellent. After a particularly delightful cold noodle dish, the vassal addressed Arjay, "Now who have you invited for my amusement, little spy?"

Arjay demurred "Most Eternal Mibu, I am but a humble attache, a functionary." The denial was not entirely convincing to Tavka, but what would a *grey* functionary know. "To my left is Anastasia Osu, a historian of the most recent Anzhalt-Eienvechni war. To my right is Emmit Raskido, Master Sargent of Your Eternal Hierarch's service and not coincidentally a veteran of the same conflict. Finally, at the captain's left is Tavka Itovanov, but a humble apparatchik." 

Emmit slowly turned their head towards Anastasia, an expression between curiosity and indignation lighting their brown eyes aflame. To Tavka's surprise, they found themselves speaking, "We studied the logistics of the Lanterran front as part of our Clerical Shuyuan on Hanstock." They felt the weight of the gazes but continued, "We often learn our greatest lessons through studying the mistakes of the past." They offered a small head bow and thought that would tie off their part of the conversation nicely. First officer Moloto undid that knot: "Mistakes? I find the idea offensive, that the Hierarch and by extension their Vassals could make something as pedestrian as a mistake." They looked toward the Vassal who simply shrugged it off "I wasn't the one in charge of that campaign, look not to me"

Tavka began to panic, "Maybe mistake was the wrong word, but there are errors - no, sorry - choices that could have different results-" They were interrupted by Emmit, who now fixed their burning eyes on the first officer, "The entire campaign was a mistake" they said firmly.

Silence fell in the dining room. Moloto gathered steam to respond but Anastasia was first to the station: "I am curious as to what in your experience led you to believe the entire campaign was a mistake?"

"You've studied it, you know the body count. What makes you think it wasn't a mistake?"

"I'm just asking for background, I'm always interested in what first person accounts have to add to the complete picture" 

"The complete picture? I was a grunt, a mud eating bug under the boot of our *Honored* Daimyo-"

Moloto interjected "Mind your tone when discussing your betters!"

"My betters?" Emmit spat the words out, their full fury focused on the lanky first officer, "What do you know about my *betters*? Did you see your comrades dissolved by plasma, starve to death, lose their limbs and lives because of my *betters*?"

"I was there too you ingrate! I was an officer, one of the *betters* you so decry and I know for a fact as though spoken by the Hierarch themselves that it was foreign interlopers colluding with republican and anarchist elements that sabotaged our glorious effort!"

"Glorious effort?" They jabbed the table with their finger "Lanterra was a wasteland of no strategic importance! Daimyo Fujschev declared it valuable, we went, and *we* died by the thousands while officers like *you* lounged in observation blimps and you want to blame any but yourselves!"

Moloto jumped to their feet, "That is *ENOUGH* Sargent! I will not stand for such slander-" They gestured at the rest of the guests "-And neither should you! I take my leave, good NIGHT" With that, they stormed out of the dining room.

Once again, the only sound was the air recycling, until the Vassal chuckled. "Such loyalty, I'm envious. Still, I've always found the 'foreign interloper' nonsense a tad far-fetched. Fujschev's reach always exceeded their grasp-"

"That's one way to phrase it" Emmit said into their drink

"- but they are House Santoku's problem, not mine. I have the privilege of serving the Hierarch from comfortably within the Eienvechni space. You, apparatchik, outline the strategic failure of the Lanterra campaign. I want to know how they teach it at my Shuyuans"

"I wouldn't dismiss the theory of interlopers and anarchists out of hand," Anastasia began, but was quickly shut up with a glare from Mibu, "I'm not here for a history lesson. Continue, please." Tavka then laid out in detail how Fujschev's advance to take Lanterra put their troops a full three days ahead of their supply train, which the Anzhalt navy was able to intercept and delay at the system's edge. The Eienvechni soldiers had only been equipped with three day supplies, accounting for distance between them and the logistics train, but the fighting on the planet took more than a month. The Anzhalt never reinforced the planet, but were content to allow a Pyrrhic Eienvechni victory. With pressure on a single gravitational approach point into the system, a handful of Anzhalt picket ships were able to stop the resupply or retreat of the Eienvechni. Food would not arrive until the armistice was signed, and the planet was ceded back to the Anzhalt. 

"It is so wonderful that they teach the basics at your Shuyuans" Anastasia said coolly. Tavka felt the blood roar behind their ears as they filled with indignation, and embarrassment at feeling that indignation. Arjay saw an opportunity to redirect and said "Well, this foreign interloper would love some desert"

Mibu laughed, "Yes, Sirja, bring sweets for the Eyes of the Raj to observe and report!" and Arjay chuckled as dinner resumed its course minus Moloto. A final service of desert and then a cordial to round it off, following which a much more relaxed looking Captain invited them all to leave. As they approached the door, Arjay bowed before Mibu and asked "Would you care to join me in the Arboretum tomorrow? There is a wonderful grove of Pacific Redwood you must see". Tavka didn't hear the reply, they were too busy racing for the elevator and the sanctuary of their cabin.
