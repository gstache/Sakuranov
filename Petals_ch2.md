## Chapter 2: A Disastrous Dinner
---

Captain Zhukarwa sat at the head of the executive dining table with their head in their hands. Their fate now rested with a mercurial overlord, a situation they had spent their whole career successfully avoiding. One late arrival, however, would be enough to undo several decades of scrupulous work and an unblemished record as a captain. Fate could be cruel.

Their self pity was interrupted by the soft chime of the doorbell. Presentation was paramount, they sat upright and smoothed their hair into its normal precise arrangement. "You may enter"

Sirja glided into the dining room and sat askance of the captain with a crisp adjustment of their white steward sash over their rose robes. Their golden brown eyes met the captains and stole Zhukarwa's breath as they had for nearly ten years. The captain's face relaxed ever so slightly as Sirja updated them on the status of service aboard the ship. The subject then turned to the dinner to be served this evening:

"I don't need to tell you how important this is" Zhukarwa began "Another mis-step, any breach in protocol, any disfavor or slight and I'll lose everything. I'll be working in a scullery until I die without my pension, you know"

"I have everything in hand" Sirja reassured them "The menu is set, the staff is briefed, all will be well"

"I hope you are right" The captain sighed. Sirja reached forward and gently took their hand.

"Viseli," The captain's rigid posture melted at their seldom used first name, "I have everything in hand. Besides, even if you lose your pension, we can still live off of mine. I also know of Mibu's style both from personal experience and gossip amongst the other stewards, and I say with certainty that you have nothing to worry about. They make a big show to keep up appearances"

"I hope you are right baldy" The pet name evinced a spectacular eye roll, even if it was accurate. Viseli enjoyed a little jest at his unflappable partner. They reached to take Sirja's other hand but stopped. A new commotion was brewing outside the dining room and was clearly on its way inside.

Without knocking and mid argument, First officer Moloto, the head of security Ibanez and the Imperator of the Vassal's Praetorian Guard barged into the dining room. Zhukarwa raised his hand to silence the trio, and then pointed to Moloto "Please explain the nature of the disagreement"

Moloto stood at attention and replied briskly "These two are undermining my authority with regards to this evenings security arrangements. Both insist on taking priority but work so sensitive requires the highest possible level of rank to oversee"

"Which is why I'm now being involved, *honored commander*?" The captain replied icily with extra emphasis on the honorific.

"My apologies, Honored Captain" Moloto bowed stiffly, "In essence, the answer is yes"

"In essence you should learn to delegate more effectively if you want the captain's sash" Zhukarwa delivered the barb pointedly. Moloto was in general an excellent and highly competent officer, but their personality truly left much to be desired. "Ibanez, what is your concern?"

"We can't effectively oversee ship security without cooperation from the Imperator and their guards. Our team is being prohibited from accessing spaces where Praetorians are on patrol, and the Imperator wants no ship security at tonight's dinner. I'm the security chief, not a store security guard!"

The Imperator shot him a cutting glare "I am solely responsible for the safety of the Vassal, Hand of the Hierarch, The Sun that Shines on the Grateful Citizens of Korido, and I will take no chances."

Captain Zhukarwa stood up and pressed both their hands firmly on the table in front of them. Gravitas manifests as a physical force in certain people, and Viseli had enough to pull the attention of everyone present without a word. The Imperator in red, Ibanez in security grey and gold and Moloto in officer white were as statues. The captain let the moment drag until they were satisfied that they had built up enough psychic weight, and issued their verdict:

"Ibanez, the Imperator will handle security this evening. It is the domain of the Vassal and that settles the matter. Honored Imperator: while your praetorians are on my ship, they will not interfere with my security personnel. You *will* provide Ibanez's team with all access they request with the exception being the immediate personal space of the vassal. They are not your enemy or a threat, work with them to extend your protection. Officer Moloto: you will handle all further conflicts regarding this issue, but allow Ibanez to perform his duties, they need not become your own."

"With all due respect, honored captain, any foreigner may be an immediate threat" The Imperator stated bluntly, firmly focused on Ibanez. 

"I trust my crew with my life, they trust me with theirs. That is all you need for reassurance. You are all dismissed."

The Imperator marched out brusquely, followed by a grumbling Ibanez. Sirja and Moloto reached the door at the same time and Moloto attempted to say something they believed out of the captain's earshot. Zhukarwa caught the last bit "-but I'm not protected by a *special relationship* with the captain". Sirja stared at Moloto with their usual inscrutable expression as Moloto stomped down the hall. Sirja and Viseli locked eyes again for a moment and Viseli sighed. Moloto was truly a miserable little cretin.

They should have declined the invitation, Tavka decided as they stepped into the elevator. This event was so far beyond their station that they could feel themselves getting smaller as the elevator raced upwards. Nervousness had infected everything in their life and preparing for dinner with the captain of a flagship inter-stellar cruise liner was no different. It had taken nearly two hours and six different outfit choices to settle on the high collared oyster shell and silver robe they currently were fidgeting with. They had tried out a brighter color, but the possibility they might upstage one of the more esteemed guests was mortifying. A deep-necked lace number had struck their fancy in the shop planetside as it showcased their graceful, narrow chest, which while immensely satisfying in the mirror prevented them from even attempting to leave the cabin. 

The elevator slowed and the doors slid open to the foyer of the executive dining room. Rich, warm, real wood floors, a spectacular double spiral staircase of mother of pearl and slate and tapestries depicting the three thousand year history of the Hierarchy greeted Tavka along with half a dozen red-robed and unusually tall people. "Please step forward" the person closest to the elevator ordered. "Spread your arms and legs" Two more stepped forward and proceeded to thoroughly pat down Tavka. Then a third approached with a hand-held scanner. Recognition hit Tavka as a rogue wave: these were Hierarchic Praetorians. The red robes trimmed in forest green, the swords and elegant pistols upon which watchful hands rested, they had seen them only on their tablet in news reports. Their worst fears about this dinner were confirmed, they would be a total social outsider. Dread followed each step up the stairs and stalled their hand at the doorbell. Fortunately or not, this was not an issue as the door slid open without input. A dark, bald person in the finest rose colored robe tied with a mother of pearl belt sash that Tavka had ever seen bowed deeply to them and invited them inside.

"Welcome Honored guest Tavka. I am chief steward Sirja and will handle any needs you may have this evening. It is my singular pleasure to introduce you to our Honored captain, Viseli Zhukarwa" They extended a white gloved hand with a flourish toward the person standing at the head of the table. The captain gave Tavka a short, polite bow which Tavka returned deeply, marveling at the poise with which the captain had adjusted their golden command sash over their white tunic. They all stood for an awkward moment while Tavka took in the view of the stars through the arched windows over the table, finally remembering that they should probably say something,

"It is an honor to meet you both" Tavka said with another deep bow.
